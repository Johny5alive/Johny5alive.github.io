<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Ok. I figured out Github Pages. Pretty Cool! I think I"ll probably go ahead and get a Wordpress subscription anyway, so I can upload music, take payments and play with a chatbot and other features. I've got a bit of money left in my band account so I won't have to go out of pocket.</p> 

<p>This will be great for getting some practice with HTML and <span>CSS</span>. I didn't really understand how I could get a website up from scratch (mostly from scratch).

thanks!!</p>
